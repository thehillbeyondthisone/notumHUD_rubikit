## Features

* **Real-Time Stat Tracking:** View your HP, Nano, core stats (AAO/AAD), damage modifiers, +XP%, and all other character skills as they update live.
* **Stat Pinning:** Quickly access your most important stats by clicking on them in the browser to "pin" them to the dedicated sidebar panel.

* **Filtering:** Instantly search for any stat across all categories using the global filter in the Stats Browser.
* **Mobile-Friendly Compact Mode:** Toggle "Compact Mode" for a streamlined, single-column layout that's perfect for mobile devices or smaller windows.
