# NotumHUD for RubiKitOS

A sleek, customizable, and real-time heads-up display (HUD) for viewing your character statistics. It connects to the included plugin to stream live stat API directly to your browser.

2.  Copy the /modules/notumHUD directory into your own module directory.
3.  Re-select your module folder in the RubiKitOS Builder menu.
4.  Open the notumHUD module from the RubiKitOS dashboard.
5.  The status indicator in the top-right corner should change from "Connecting..." to "Live". Your stats will begin to stream in.
6.  Troubleshooting & Self-checks are available in the menu on the lower right corner.
